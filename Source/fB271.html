	<h2>Garland of Night-Blooming Water Lilies<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></h2>
<h3>A Commentary on the Guru Siddhi Mantra</h3>
<p><strong><em>by JigmÃ© TenpÃ© Nyima</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Homage to Padmasambhava, Glorious Great Bliss!</em></p>
<p><em>Wisdom-kÄya, unity beyond all training,<br/>
Your dazzling smile is the play of immortal empty bliss.<br/>
A resplendent moon new-birthed from a lotus,<br/>
Arising in the city of the wheel of enjoyment,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
You are the epitome of whatever brings joy!</em> </p>
<p>There are many ways to discuss this king of secret mantras. Now everyoneâstarting with young monks, barely able to fasten their belts, who perform ritual services for even the livestock of rich householdersârecites the syllables of this mantra, loudly boasting tall claims. It appears that they have not, however, so much as approached gaining certainty about its meaning. So I will explain it in colloquial terms, using phrasing that is concise and easy to understand. My intended audience is neither the great scholar-practitioners of the Nyingma tantras, nor the orthodox scholars who adhere to the dry words of disputative intellectualists. This is not a point-scoring investigation concerned with being systematic; I am writing for the many town-dweller mantrins, neither monk nor bÃ¶npo, who mistakenly confuse the fundamentals of Secret Mantra with mantra of their own creation. Those of you with weak intelligence, unable to understand grand structures of meaning but interested nonetheless in reciting this mantraâyou non-intellectuals, casually lend your ears and take in the nonsense of these words. </p>
<p>I will explain it in accordance with the life and liberation stories of Padma, Lord of Victors. That way, the mantra will be easy to bring to mind.</p>
<p>There are two parts to this:<br/>
1. Recalling the qualities of the Great Master<br/>
1.1. The main explanation of the Masterâs vast qualities<br/>
1.1.1. The presentation of the general mantra [oá¹, Äá¸¥ and hÅ«á¹]<br/>
1.1.2. The presentation of [vajra guru,] the specific mantra according to the main events of Guru RinpochÃ©âs life and liberation<br/>
1.2 A description of [padma,] the name of the Guru who possesses these qualities<br/>
2. Supplicating him to grant all our wishes, perfectly and completely [with siddhi hÅ«á¹]. </p>
<h2>1. Recalling the qualities of the Great Master</h2>
<h3>1.1. The main explanation of the Masterâs vast qualities</h3>
<h4>1.1.1. The presentation of the general mantra oá¹, Äá¸¥ and hÅ«á¹</h4>
<p>The mantra begins with âoá¹ Äh hÅ«á¹â. Generally, âoá¹â is placed at the beginning of a mantra. Oá¹ is the mantra of consecration: it imparts glory, makes good fortune abound, and much more beside. In short, it is explained in The <em>Tip of The Vajra</em><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> and elsewhere that âoá¹â embodies auspiciousness. In this context, however, all three syllables togetherâoá¹ Äh hÅ«á¹âshall be explained as being the essence of the three vajras:</p>
<h5>The meaning of the syllable oá¹</h5>
<p>âOá¹â refers to the vajra-body of the buddhas. While generally all the buddha form bodies are vajra, it is primarily âoá¹â that the scriptures call the âwisdom wind swirling in basic space.â In other words, wind can be the pure support for the great bliss of co-emergent wisdom, and, when it has gained strength or reached maturity, it thus can become of a single essence with the innate mind of great bliss. In the uncommon system of unsurpassed mantra, the coarse and subtle bodies are divided into three: 1) the inner coarse body, 2) the outer coarse body, and 3) the subtle body with its three thousand subdivisions, along which the wind element travels. When all these winds are pacified within the complete and utter purity of basic space, the innate wind will arise as the mudrÄ of the magical net of empty-appearance. This is given the name âthe vajrakÄya of the rainbow body of great transference.â</p>
<h5>The meaning of the syllable Äá¸¥</h5>
<p>âÄá¸¥â refers to vajra-speech. Moreover, as is taught in the <em>Magical Net</em>:<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âAâ is not empty, nor is it not empty,<br/>
Nor is it an objectifiable middle. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that general context, vajra-speech is the totality of the tonal modulations of all the buddhasâ speech â limitless and in harmony with the different convictions and conceptions of all types of beings. Yet in the uncommon system of Atiyoga, the king of vehicles, the letter 'A' signifies the unchanging, definitive meaning. Another tantra states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the heart center it shines,<br/>
Indestructible and pure, like a lamp;<br/>
Unchanging and most subtle â<br/>
âAâ, the sacred lord. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains the syllable 'A' as symbolizing the drop of unchanging wind-mind. It holds the same meaning as the inexpressible bindu of empty-awareness â the inwardly radiant youthful body in the vase of the luminous vajra-peak. It appears as the natural sound of the <em>cakra</em> of windâs expression<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>. It is also the basis for all expression that emerges from within basic space. This will be easy to understand if one becomes well-versed in the different stages of the windâs expansion and gathering from birth to death.</p>
<h5>The meaning of the syllable hÅ«á¹</h5>
<p>âHÅ«á¹â refers to the vajra mind of all buddhas. It is the luminous, naturally arisen wisdom which is of a single taste with the spontaneously present subtle wind, the quintessence of the vajra rainbow body of great transference mentioned above. âHÅ«á¹â is thus the true nature, the final character actualized of all that is; it is purity reaching its ultimate horizon. Ever-pristine empty-awareness is never not composed within the unborn nature that is free from all complexity; yet, incidentally, all pure qualities are there, totally complete and manifest, in their transience. All the infinite great qualities of the buddhas are indivisible â such as the ten powers and the four types of fearlessness â and so the word âvajraâ is applied.</p>
<p>It is therefore rightly said that the vast collected qualities of the tathÄgatasâ three vajras are fully perfected within the nature of the inexhaustible wheel of adorment of the Lord PadmÄkaraâs three secrets. It goes without saying that there are also the uncommon profound points within the systems of SÅ«tra and Tantra in general, the unsurpassable system of Secret Mantra in particular, and especially in our system of the natural Great Perfection. Indeed, an explanation of these by an immature numbskull such as myself could probably fill a whole stack of pointless volumes. But, as I have said, this text is just an introduction for young venerables my own age, and for simple, older folk.</p>
<h4>1.1.2. The presentation of [vajra guru,] the specific mantra according to the main events of Guru RinpochÃ©âs life and liberation.</h4>
<p>âVajra guruâ translates into Tibetan as âdorjÃ© lama,â [and into English as âvajra or indestructible teacherâ]. As it says in <em>The Meeting of Father and Son</em>:<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So that the Great Hero, highly skilled in means,<br/>
Would completely ripen sentient beings,<br/>
The Victor, in millions upon millions of worlds,<br/>
Displayed himself as the Buddha.<br/>
Even now, O Guide,<br/>
You perform this display of many Buddhas. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reality, the Lord of Victors PadmÄkara had already accomplished complete and great awakening uncountable eons ago. Yet, from the perspective of disciples with limited perception, PadmÄkara took birth within a thousand-petalled lotus that was bursting into flower on the waters of the Sindhu Ocean, a display of his having accomplished the deathless state of a âvidyÄdhara in trainingâ. Thus the Vajraguru is renowned as the âGreat Ocean-Born Varjadhara.â While the story of his life and liberation goes far beyond words, in essence he is one who became fully awakened through the path of Unsurpassable Yoga, the VajrayÄna.</p>
<p>To begin with, when PadmÄkara was invested with sacred royal power over Uá¸á¸iyÄna, the land of the blind and wealthy King IndrabhÅ«ti, he was just like the glorious Saraha being empowered into the essence of the <em>BuddhakapÄla-tantra</em>.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> Due to his training from the past, in this life he naturally perfected the path of accumulation â the development stage of the path of profound mantra, and the path of joining â the perfection stage wherein the vital points of the vajra places are applied.</p>
<p>Abroad, in ÅÄ«tavana, the great Cool Grove charnel ground, PadmÄkara performed the enhancement practices of yogic conduct. As Saraha, the Archer, taught:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make song, dance and music<br/>
Resound in all directions!<br/>
As yoginÄ«s circle to the right,<br/>
By going beyond reference points<br/>
Your conduct will be effortless. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the power of the intrinsic vajra-samÄdhi of innate great joy, blissful yet empty, with its expanding display of pure realms, mantras, and the great assembly of innate yoginis, PadmÄkara effortlessly actualized the level of âsupreme Dharmaâ, on the Path of Joining, according to the unsurpassable mantra. </p>
<p>When PadmÄkara went in secret to meet with VihÄrdhara, king of Zahor and with IndrabhÅ«ti, king of Uá¸á¸iyÄna, both rulers attempted to burn his holy body.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> Each time, the tongues of flame from the sesame oil-soaked sandalwood transformed into cool flowing streams of water, and PadmÄkara appeared fresh and cool upon the stalk of a magical flower. This is just one of the events that occurred. These were imprints of his accomplishment on the path of joining â his attainment of the unsurpassable level of âsupreme Dharmaâ. For even in the common <em>pÄramitÄ</em> vehicle it is said that âthose in their final existenceâ will not die of themselves, nor will they die from others. From explanations in the basic Abhidharma alone, it can be ascertained that the bodily support of âone of unsurpassable supreme Dharmaâ will become the unified form of a vajra-holder beyond transference. It goes without saying, therefore, that any harm inflicted on PadmÄkara, arising from the inner or outer elements, could never actually touch him. Like the depths of the ocean, this and other kinds of magical, yogic conduct are difficult, in their profundity, for immature beingsâ minds to understand. Such is the great wave of benefit he performed for himself and others. </p>
<p>Furthermore, PadmÄkara actualized ultimate luminosity, which is the single taste and inseparable essence of the twofold profound insight. This, known as being âendowed with all supreme characteristicsâ, indicates the total pacification of the most subtle distinctions of dualistic experience: 1) in reference to innate wisdom, and 2) in reference to the suchness of phenomena. To achieve this, Guru RinpochÃ© relied upon the swift means of <em>gaá¹acakra</em> at YangleshÃ¶, in Nepal, and so manifested the accomplishment of âthe supreme siddhi of mahÄmudrÄâ. The one who fully perfected the supreme path, who is renowned as âvidyÄdhara with power over lifeâ, thus attained the path of seeing of unsurpassable Mantra. As it says in the prayer of vajra-words,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> âIn this sacred place, you attained the siddhi of mahÄmudrÄ.â</p>
<p>The omniscient Rigdzin JigmÃ© Lingpa explains that âthe supreme siddhi of mahÄmudrÄâ corresponds to the path of seeing on the path of unsurpassable Mantra.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>
<p>In brief, the term âlamaâ in Tibetan [or âmasterâ in English] is the equivalent of âguru.â The word âguruâ is derived from âguá¹a,â which means qualities, and âru,â which means weighty. Thus the Great Masterâs mind is filled and weighty with qualities. What is the cause for the heaviness? By what means has it become heavy? And just what are the qualities that make it weighty? As they say, âvajra is weighty in terms of being indestructible.â </p>
<p>The main cause for its weight is that it can never be destroyed by the adventitious stains of deluded thinking. Therefore it is known as the indestructible vajra mind, or innate mind â the luminous ground, the great liberation, the ground of the youthful vase body. The co-emergent conditions for this to occur are 1) the profound generation stage: the path which is similar in aspect to the subtle wisdom of inner clarity, the true state of the ground â the spontaneously present dawning of empty-appearance; and 2) the final, extraordinary completion stage â the realization that the three realms of saá¹sÄra have always been liberated. By these and other means, the result â the three vajras of the buddhas â is practiced, and thus it is known as âthe vajra path, unsurpassed.â </p>
<p>What are these qualities, in essence? By relying upon the skillful means of the vajra path â the wisdom of the vajra ground â the expanse of the object becomes the innate nature of self-aware luminosity, the great vastness free from limitations. Within this same expanse, the subject, the indestructible wisdom of the great perfection which has arrived at the six special attributes,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> is brought to perfection as the essence of totally complete, spontaneously present vajra qualities. This is precisely the meaning communicated by the term âvajra.â</p>
<h3>1.2. A description of âPadmaâ, the name of the Guru who possesses those qualities.</h3>
<p>Who is it that possesses that ocean-like array of marvelous qualities, secret and unsurpassed? Here, on the occasion of this teaching, it is the one renowned as âPerfect Buddha Padmaâ within the infinite pure-lands of the three kÄya buddhas.â Why was he named Padma? He was miraculously born within the bud of a padma, a lotus flower, and was thus named after his <em>origins</em>. Since Padma was the magical display of the omniscient wisdom of the heart of AmitÄbha, tathÄgata of the Padma family, the name Padma implies likewise to this same wisdom essence. One could also say the name applies to the whole <em>family</em>. As is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isnât he the Lotus King, victorious over the cannibal demon RÄvaá¹a,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a><br/>
Who has traversed the tenth bhÅ«mi by means of a consort? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, he could also have been named Padma because he is the lord of <em>enjoyment</em> who has accomplished union, the level of the great Vajradhara, by relying on the padma of the vajra-queen. He could also have the name Padma in terms of the <em>function</em> of being free from the bondage of desire â for the display of his illusory rÅ«pakÄya appears to worldly beings like the moonâs reflection in water, in the same way that a lotus rises from the mud but is not sullied by it. A name can be given for many reasons, in terms of: 1) <em>origins</em>, such as Of the Golden Womb;<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> 2) <em>family</em>, like Great God;<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> 3) <em>enjoyment</em>, like flower-eater;<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> and 4) <em>function</em>, like lotus-enemy.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> Therefore he has been given names such as Great Master PadmÄkara, Padmasambhava, and Lotus-Born (<em>padma skyes</em>). While it is well understood that most of these names have been ascribed in terms of the first way,<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> all four reasons apply to the name âPadma.â</p>
<p>One could argue, âIf the only reason for calling him Padma, from the perspective of <em>enjoyment</em> and <em>function</em>, is the extraordinary accomplishments he gained from the said perspectives (as explained above), then all the mahÄsiddhas of India and Tibet would likewise be called Padma.â Do not reason like an idiot! Bodhisattvas like GaganagaÃ±ja and VajrapÄá¹i have immeasurably great compassion but received different names due to the stories found in their lives and liberations. Likewise, Noble AvalokiteÅvara, Surveyor of All, was given his name due to precisely this quality. </p>
<p>âWhy, then,â you might ask, âwas âPadmaâ written in the countless stories of the Precious Masterâs life and liberation only from the perspective of his qualities, and not in terms of <em>enjoyment</em> and <em>function</em>?â I would say in reply that it is well-established that one can condense all the enlightened qualities into the above-mentioned <em>enjoyment</em> and <em>function</em>. Moreover, it is not necessary to give a name that encompasses all the qualities. In popular legend, Viá¹£á¹u has qualities other than simply that of having slain the asura Kaá¹sa<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a>â an insignificant event. Yet even now Viá¹£á¹u is known as Kaá¹sÄrÄti, 'Enemy of Kaá¹sa.' You could object, âBut there are other names for Viá¹£á¹u, aside from Kaá¹sÄrÄti!â This is true, and likewise the Great Master has countless names, such as those of the Eight Manifestations, and those of the Twenty Emanations. However, it would serve little purpose to list all of them here, so that will be enough for now.</p>
<h2>2. Supplicating him to grant all our wishes, perfectly and completely [with siddhi hÅ«á¹]</h2>
<h3>2.1. Requesting the object of oneâs desire, siddhi</h3>
<p>Siddhi means âaccomplishment.â Accomplishment, moreover, has two aspects: supreme and common. The former, supreme accomplishment, refers to the ultimate wisdom of no-more-learning, the unified kÄya, and to enlightened activities beyond the imagination. According to this system, all the qualities of abandonment and realization of the four types of vidyÄdharas are called the supreme accomplishments. While the matured vidyÄdhara is still an ordinary tantric practitioner, this is nonetheless accepted by the Lord of Victors, Pema Ledrol<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> as a âsupreme accomplishmentâ. Thus one should not assume that the supreme accomplishment only begins with the above-mentioned attainment of mahÄmudrÄ. </p>
<p>âCommon accomplishmentâ refers to accomplishments that are common to practitioners of the development stage, such as the eight accomplishments and the twelve offices. Through these, one provisionally gains control over the manifold yogic disciplines of the four enlightened activities. </p>
<p>Thus, through the common accomplishments, one is able to accomplish a great wave of benefit for beings through the skillful means of subjugating and caring for others. And, by ascending the staircase of the four ultimate vidyÄdhara levels, the supreme accomplishments, one will swiftly and effortlessly attain the unity of no more learning, the level of the great sovereign VajradhÄra. Thus one says, âsuch is the object of my desire!â</p>
<h3>2.2. The quintessence of invocation, hÅ«á¹</h3>
<p>âHÅ«á¹â is the mantra syllable that invokes the accomplishments of the three vajras, symbolized by the three characters ha, u, and á¹. Also, hÅ«á¹ is the quintessence<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> of the vajra of enlightened mind, and so it invokes the full realization of the enlightened mind in bestowing accomplishment. The basis for that accomplishment is hÅ«á¹, but the symbolic meaning indicates the thusness which abides as the essence of oneâs own three doors, which are primordially indestructible, innate liberation. Thus, the main cause for the wisdom which is the supreme, primary accomplishment dwells within oneself. The co-emergent condition is the invocation of Guru RinpochÃ©âs compassion, and the concordant factor is the ground for the arising of all common existence. In brief, hÅ«á¹ summons accomplishments and is the quintessence of stability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for those of you who have obtained the empowerments of the unsurpassed Mantra, these explanations will steady your faith in the syllables of this particular mantra. For those of lesser intelligence, this teaching is just a rough outline of the syllablesâ meaning. To those who are unable to comprehend even that much, I would explain that this mantra can be translated as: âYou who are the identity of the three vajras (or you who are heavy and full with the immeasurably great qualities of the three vajras), we call upon you, âPadma,â Lord of Victors! Bestow your blessings upon us!â </p>
<p>The three vajras are the enlightened body, speech, and mind. What indicates these? âOá¹, Äá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ vajraâ are their indication. âWeighty with qualitiesâ means weighty in major and minor marks of the body, with completeness and timbre of speech, and with the omniscience of the enlightened mind. Itâs not heavy like the weight of coin, but heavy like the Earth itself. What shows this? âGuru,â the condensation of âguá¹aâ and âru,â does. Padma is easy enough to understand: it is the name of the Great Master. As for what we call âaccomplishment,â even though there are many supreme and common accomplishments, we should explain it in a way that accords with modern people, whose minds are narrow as the eye of a needle. Thus it would run something like this: more food and yaks, higher yields in sheep and cattle, and no loss or misfortune on the full or new moons. HÅ«á¹ is an invocation to bestow the siddhi of these accomplishments.</p>
<p>It would be excellent to explain this king of the vastness of mantra in terms of its connection to the whole body of the path, but for now Iâve just set down whatever came to mind, rather like beating a bag of tsampa. Itâs the work of a dull-witted simpleton; that much I know.</p>
<p>Young roaming monks, content to receive donations,<br/>
And new lamas refining thoughts like so much turmeric during rituals,<br/>
If you donât understand even this much of the meaning of mantra,<br/>
Your tears will fall later, when you consider how it will ripen â<br/>
The eating of food that has been given in good faith. </p>

<p>The six special attributes (<em>khyad chos drug</em>) define the process of gaining realization within the ground of being according to the Atiyoga teachings.
